# Two Sum

## 1. Question:
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Example: 
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## 2. Solution: 

As we all known, if we want to find the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target, the 
first idea must be this one: We can try every element of the array. However, there is another way. We can use more 
room instead of time. 

### Example (Java):
